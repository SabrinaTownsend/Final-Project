        <h1 class="col-left">&ThinSpace; I am a part-time teacher who has found organizing a peaceful act since I was a little girl. 
        <div> &ThinSpace; My organizing journey started in 2002 by helping neighbors organize and tidy every room in their homes. Many years later, while attending Fresno State University, I was head of the homeless department at the VA Hospital and created a system for their daily donations. After graduating with my teaching credential, I assisted other teachers by transforming their rooms into efficient work spaces.</div>
        <div>&ThinSpace;My mission is to offer my expertise to those wanting to recreate order and take power over their environment again.</div>
        </h1>

        <h2 class="col-right">Can you relate to any of the following?
            <ul>
                <li>Do you have places in your work space that make the day harder?</li>
                    <div>I CAN FIX THAT!</div>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Do you have too much clutter and don't know where to start?</li>
                    <div>I CAN HELP WITH THAT!</div>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Do you need to get things done in a timely manner?</li>
                    <div>I CAN HANDLE THAT!</div>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="col-left">
            <div style="text-decoration:underline">What type of Queen are you?</div>
            <div> &ThinSpace;For instance, my organizing style is typically out of sight out of mind. I prefer to maximize my storage space and have everything put away or "have a home" so that i dont get overwhelemed in my space and can find things easily. Therefore, I am a Queen of Hearts who enjoys a clear and open space to work in.</div>
